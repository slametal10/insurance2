            Larry A. Silverstein (born May 30, 1931) is an American billionaire businessman.  Among his real estate projects, he is the developer of the rebuilt World Trade Center complex in Lower Manhattan, New York City, as well as one of New York's tallest residential towers at 30 Park Place, where he owns a home. As of December 2024, he had an estimated net worth of US$1 billion according to Forbes.<br/><br/>Silverstein was born in Brooklyn, and became involved in real estate, together with his father, establishing Silverstein Properties.  Silverstein separated from his business partner, Bernard Mendik, in 1977, and bought a number of large office buildings in Midtown and Lower Manhattan in the late 1970s.  In 1980, he won a bid from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to construct 7 World Trade Center on Vesey Street, just north of the main World Trade Center site.  He was interested in acquiring the original World Trade Center complex, and put in a bid when the Port Authority put it up for lease in 2000.  He won the bid when a deal between the initial winner and the Port Authority fell through, and he signed the lease on July 24, 2001.<br/><br/>Soon after the September 11 attacks, in 2001, Silverstein declared his intent to rebuild, though he and his insurers became embroiled in a multi-year dispute over whether the attacks had constituted one event or two under the terms of the insurance policy, which provided for a maximum of $3.55 billion coverage per event.  A settlement was reached in 2007, with insurers agreeing to pay out $4.55 billion, which was not as much as Silverstein had sought.
