            Eagle Insurance is a vehicle insurance agency based in Chicago, Illinois, which has been serving residents of the metropolitan area since 1961. It is best known for its unusual, low-budget television commercials featuring the egg-laying "Eagle Man," an actor in a bald eagle costume.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Advertising ==<br/><br/>The first, and best known, of the Eagle Insurance television spots was created in 1993 by RDR Productions of Glenview, Illinois. In the commercial, two young women are riding in an automobile when they suddenly hear a loud thud emanating from the roof of their car. Having no vehicle insurance, they realize they have been visited by Eagle Man, who speaks in a slow, deep voice and proclaims, "I've … got … something … for … you!" He then squats down and inexplicably lays an oversized egg, out of which hatches a hand puppet. The chick presents a piece of paper listing Eagle's vehicle insurance rates, and the women exclaim in unison, "Ohhh, look at those low rates." An announcer then provides a detailed description of all of Eagle Insurance's services.<br/><br/>The original version of the commercial quickly gained a cult following in the Chicago area, and RDR responded with a series of equally unusual "sequels." One sequel replaced Eagle Man with "Eagle Woman," and featured a cameo by radio personality Erich "Mancow" Muller, a fan of the original spot. All of these advertisements have been dubbed in Spanish. In addition, a radio advertisement featuring the "Eagle Man Rap" aired in the Chicago area for several years. RDR most recently produced an updated version of the original television spot which incorporates CGI effects to portray Eagle Man's frequently-mentioned egg-laying scene.
