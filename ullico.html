Formerly known as Union Labor Life Insurance Company, it was founded in 1927 by the American Federation of Labor (AFL) and its then president, Samuel Gompers, to offer health and life insurance products specifically to working men and women. Matthew Woll, president of the International Photo-Engravers Union of North America, became the company's first president. Ullico is one of the largest insurance and investment services companies for trade union members in the United States.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Overview ==<br/><br/>Ullico Inc.'s mission is to provide financial security to union members and their families. The company offers specialty insurance and investment products to labor organizations, union employers, municipalities and institutional investors, as well as union members and retirees. Ullico is a privately held, joint stock company. The company's constitution and bylaws permit shares to be held only by trade unions, union officials, union members and union benefit funds. The stock's value changes once a year when company directors set a new share price based on the advice of independent auditors.
