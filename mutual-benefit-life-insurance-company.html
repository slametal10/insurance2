            The Mutual Benefit Life Insurance Company was a life insurance company  that was chartered in 1845 and based in Newark in Essex County, New Jersey, United States. The company was headed by Frederick Frelinghuysen (1848–1924).  The company was known as the "Tiffany" of insurance companies, a reference to its reputation as the life insurance company to the upper classes.<br/><br/>Mutual Benefit Life was taken into receivership for rehabilitation by the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance on July 16, 1991, after losses in an overheated real estate market led to a run by policyholders, who ultimately lost the purported "cash value" that had been said to have accrued in their policies. At the time, the collapse was the largest ever of an American insurer.  AMEV acquired the group life, accident and health insurance Mutual Benefit in 1991. SunAmerica acquired the remaining divisions in 1998. Effective June 14, 2001, Mutual Benefit was liquidated and dissolved.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Landmark buildings ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>Mutual Benefit commissioned a number of landmark buildings in Newark for their headquarters.<br/><br/>After outgrowing previous locations at Broad and Market (from the 1845 founding to 1848), then another ten years in the Insurance Buildings on Market Street, the company built a headquarters at the corner of Broad and Clinton Streets in 1858.
