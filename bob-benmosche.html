            Robert Herman  Benmosche ( ben-moh-SHAY, May 29, 1944 – February 27, 2015) was the president and chief executive officer of American International Group (NYSE: AIG). He was appointed President &amp; Chief Executive Officer by the US Department of Treasury and AIG Board of Directors to succeed Edward M. Liddy. Benmosche is known for his leadership at AIG, where he led a turnaround, improved profits 60% year over year, and paid down government aid pledged by the Bush and Obama Administrations.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early life ==<br/><br/>Benmosche was born in Brooklyn, New York. Benmosche traced his Jewish lineage back to Lithuania, where his great-grandfather, Moshe Kreiskol, was one of the first Jews to serve in the tsar's army in the 1830s. Benmosche's grandfather, Rabbi Herman Benmosche moved the family to the US in 1894.<br/><br/>Benmosche's father died when Benmosche was 10 years old. His estate included a newly constructed motel in the Borscht Belt—the small towns in the Catskills where New York City Jews summered; and $250,000 debt. The family kept the motel. Benmosche himself took a series of jobs, working there, caddying, and later, driving a delivery truck.
