            Builder's risk insurance (Contractor's All Risk insurance – CAR insurance) is a type of property insurance which indemnifies against damage to buildings while they are under construction. Builder's risk insurance is "coverage that protects a person's or organization's insurable interest in materials, fixtures and/or equipment being used in the construction or renovation of a building or structure should those items sustain physical loss or damage from a covered cause."<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Necessity ==<br/><br/>Buildings are subject to many different risks while under construction. They may catch fire, be damaged by high winds, or fall victim to other force majeure. A principle of common law is that any new construction or other improvement to land becomes property of the owner of the land – the title holder – once there has been an "improvement" to the owner's site. Builder's risk insurance indemnifies against some of these particular losses.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Coverage ==<br/><br/>Builder's risk covers perils such as fire, wind, theft, vandalism and many more. It typically does not cover perils such as earthquake, flood or hurricane damage unless the policy has been specifically endorsed to do so. However, earthquake riders can be economical, depending on where a project is located. These policies do not cover accidents and injuries at the workplace. and are intended to terminate when the work has been completed and the property is ready for use or occupancy.
