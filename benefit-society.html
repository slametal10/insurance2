            A benefit society, fraternal benefit society, fraternal benefit order, friendly society, or mutual aid organization is a voluntary association formed to provide mutual aid, benefit, for instance insurance for relief from sundry difficulties. Such organizations may be formally organized with charters and established customs or may arise ad hoc to meet the unique needs of a particular time and place.<br/><br/>Many major financial institutions existing today, particularly some insurance companies, mutual savings banks, and credit unions, trace their origins back to benefit societies, as can many modern fraternal organizations and fraternal orders which are now viewed as being primarily social. The modern legal system essentially requires all such organizations of appreciable size to incorporate one of these forms or another to continue to exist on an ongoing basis.<br/><br/>Benefit societies may be organized around a shared ethnic background, religion, occupation, geographical region, or other basis. Benefits may include financial security or assistance for education, unemployment, birth of a baby, sickness and medical expenses, retirement, and funerals. Often, benefit societies provide a social or educational framework for members and their families to support each other and contribute to the wider community.<br/><br/>Examples of benefit societies include trade unions, burial societies, friendly societies, cooperatives, credit unions, self-help groups, landsmanshaftn, immigrant hometown societies, fraternal organizations built upon the models of fraternal orders such as the Freemasons and the Oddfellows, some coworking communities, and many others.<br/><br/>A benefit society can be characterized by <br/><br/><br/><br/>members having equivalent opportunity for a say in the organization<br/><br/>members having potentially equivalent benefits<br/><br/>aid going to those in need (strong helping the weak)<br/><br/>a collection fund for payment of benefits<br/><br/>educating others about a group's interest<br/><br/>preserving cultural traditions<br/><br/>mutual deference<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History of benefit societies ==<br/><br/>Examples of benefit societies can be found throughout history, including among secret societies of the Tang Dynasty in China and African-Americans during the post-revolutionary years, such as those who organized the Free African Society of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Philadelphia's first black organization, the Free African Society, was established in 1787 by two African American former slaves, Absalom Jones and Richard Allen.
