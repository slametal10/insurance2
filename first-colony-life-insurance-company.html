Employment nearly doubled from 800 employees in 1996 to more than 1,500 employees in 1999, including more than 750 employees at a new separate Customer Service Center facility in Lynchburg.<br/><br/>BGA distribution continued as First Colony Life's primary life insurance and annuity sales channel with a sales force of more than 135,000 independent life insurance agents and brokers.<br/><br/>On January 1, 2007, First Colony Life Insurance Company merged into Genworth Life and Annuity Insurance Company, a Genworth Financial company.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== key dates ===<br/><br/>1955: First Colony Life Insurance Company founded by Edwin Horner in Lynchburg, VA.<br/><br/>1963: Broadway-Hale, a California department store chain (later Carter Hawley Hale Stores), purchases controlling interests in FCL.<br/><br/>1965: Los Angeles Investment Company buys out Broadway-Hale's majority stock block.
