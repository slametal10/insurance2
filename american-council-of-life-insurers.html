        <img alt="American Council of Life Insurers headquarters" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ed/101_Constitution_Ave_NW%2C_Washington%2C_DC_April_2019.jpg"/>
        
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>The American Council of Life Insurers (ACLI) is the premier trade association representing the life insurance industry in the United States. Headquartered in Washington, D.C., ACLI serves as the unified voice for 275 member companies that provide financial protection and security to approximately 90 million American families. The organization plays a critical role in shaping public policy, advocating for favorable legislation, and promoting the value of life insurance products.</p>

        <h2>History and Background</h2>
        <p>Founded in 1976 through the merger of two predecessor organizations, ACLI has grown to become one of the most influential insurance trade associations in the nation. The organization traces its roots back to the early 20th century when the need for a unified voice for life insurers became apparent as government regulation of the industry increased.</p>

        <p>ACLI's headquarters at 101 Constitution Avenue NW in Washington, D.C. positions it strategically near the nation's legislative and regulatory centers, allowing for effective advocacy and policy influence.</p>

        <h2>Member Companies and Industry Impact</h2>
        <p>ACLI member companies represent approximately 90% of the life insurance industry's assets in the United States. These companies offer a comprehensive range of financial protection products including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Term and permanent life insurance policies</li>
            <li>Annuities and retirement income products</li>
            <li>Disability income insurance</li>
            <li>Long-term care insurance</li>
            <li>Supplemental health benefits</li>
            <li>Paid family leave solutions</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Collectively, ACLI members hold more than $7 trillion in assets, making the life insurance industry one of the largest sources of investment capital in the nation. These investments support infrastructure projects, create jobs, and contribute to economic growth.</p>

        <h2>Leadership</h2>
        <p>Susan K. Neely has served as ACLI's president and CEO since 2018. With extensive experience in both government and association leadership, Neely previously served as president and CEO of the American Beverage Association and as Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.</p>
