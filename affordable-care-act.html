            <h2>Key Provisions of the Affordable Care Act</h2>

            <h3>Delivery System Reforms</h3>
            <p>The ACA included numerous provisions aimed at improving healthcare quality and reducing costs:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs):</strong> Provider networks that share savings when they deliver care more efficiently</li>
                <li><strong>Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program:</strong> Financial penalties for excessive readmissions</li>
                <li><strong>Value-Based Purchasing:</strong> Medicare payments tied to quality metrics</li>
                <li><strong>Prevention and Public Health Fund:</strong> $15 billion investment in prevention programs</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Impact of the Affordable Care Act</h2>
            
            <h3>Coverage Expansion</h3>
            <p>By 2016, the uninsured rate had fallen to a historic low of 8.6%, down from 16% in 2010. The biggest coverage gains occurred among:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Low-income adults in Medicaid expansion states</li>
                <li>Young adults (19-25) benefiting from dependent coverage</li>
                <li>Self-employed individuals and small business employees</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Health Outcomes</h3>
            <p>Studies have shown significant improvements in access to care and health outcomes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Increased early cancer diagnoses in Medicaid expansion states</li>
                <li>Improved diabetes management and medication adherence</li>
                <li>Reduced racial disparities in insurance coverage</li>
                <li>Lower mortality rates in expansion states</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Economic Effects</h3>
            <p>The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projected that the ACA would reduce the federal deficit by $143 billion over 10 years, primarily through:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>New taxes on high-income earners (3.8% investment income tax)</li>
                <li>Fees on health insurers and pharmaceutical companies</li>
                <li>Reductions in Medicare Advantage payments</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Controversies and Legal Challenges</h2>
            
            <p>The ACA has faced numerous political and legal challenges since its passage:</p>
            
            <h3>Major Supreme Court Cases</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>NFIB v. Sebelius (2012):</strong> Upheld individual mandate as tax but made Medicaid expansion optional</li>
                <li><strong>King v. Burwell (2015):</strong> Preserved subsidies in federal exchange states</li>
                <li><strong>California v. Texas (2021):</strong> Rejected challenge to individual mandate after penalty was repealed</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Political Opposition</h3>
            <p>Republicans made numerous attempts to repeal the ACA, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>50+ House votes to repeal all or parts of the law</li>
                <li>2017 repeal effort that failed by one Senate vote</li>
                <li>Expansion of short-term health plans as alternative</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Current Status and Future Outlook</h2>
            
            <p>As of 2023, the ACA remains largely intact with some modifications:</p>
            <ul>

            </ul>
            
            <h3>Ongoing Debates</h3>
            <p>Key issues in current healthcare policy discussions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Public option proposals to compete with private insurers</li>
                <li>Medicare expansion to younger age groups</li>
                <li>Prescription drug price negotiations</li>
                <li>Surprise billing protections</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
            
            <h3>Is Obamacare the same as the Affordable Care Act?</h3>
            <p>Yes, "Obamacare" is the informal name for the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Both terms refer to the same healthcare reform law passed in 2010.</p>
            
            <h3>How do I enroll in an ACA health plan?</h3>
            <p>You can enroll through HealthCare.gov or your state's marketplace during the annual Open Enrollment Period (typically November-December) or qualify for a Special Enrollment Period after life events like job loss or marriage.</p>
            
            <h3>What happens if I don't have health insurance?</h3>
            <p>While the federal penalty for being uninsured was reduced to $0 starting in 2019, some states have implemented their own individual mandates with penalties.</p>
            
            <h3>Can I be denied coverage for pre-existing conditions?</h3>
            <p>No, the ACA prohibits insurers from denying coverage or charging more based on pre-existing health conditions.</p>
