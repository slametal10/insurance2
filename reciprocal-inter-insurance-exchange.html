<h1>Reciprocal inter-insurance exchange</h1>
            
            A reciprocal inter-insurance exchange or simply a reciprocal in the United States is an unincorporated association in which subscribers exchange insurance policies to pool and spread risk.  For consumers, reciprocal exchanges often offer similar policies to those offered by a stock company or a mutual insurance company.  Notable reciprocal exchanges are managed by USAA, Farmers, and Erie.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>Reciprocals began in 1881 when dry-good merchants in New York were discontent with their experience with other insurers in covering their buildings. The store owners believed that they had well-maintained buildings and were being overcharged by risk rating methodologies used by insurers at the time.  Because the merchants were well-capitalized and could absorb certain losses, they decided to self-insure to lower their insurance costs. Subscribers indemnified each other when a member suffered a loss, but the process of collecting from those who did not suffer and remitting funds to those who did suffer losses proved cumbersome.  Reciprocal exchanges managed by attorneys-in-fact thus were organized to address this problem.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== How a reciprocal operates ==<br/><br/>"Reciprocal insurance" means insurance resulting from the mutual exchange of insurance contracts among persons in an unincorporated association under a common name through an attorney-in-fact having authority to obligate each person both as insured and insurer.<br/><br/>This definition implies three parties: the Subscribers (policyholders), the exchange (an unincorporated association), and the attorney-in-fact.
