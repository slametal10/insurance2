            The Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC) is a wholly owned government corporation managed by the Risk Management Agency of the United States Department of Agriculture. FCIC manages the federal crop insurance program, which provides U.S. farmers and agricultural entities with crop insurance protection.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Background ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>During the 1930s, farmers thought they were safe during the Great Depression because they could provide food for themselves. That changed quickly when the Dust Bowl drought made it difficult for farmers to produce any crops during this time. By not being able to produce these essential crops, they lacked necessary food for themselves and were unable to make money off of the crops. In order to help America recover from the Great Depression, President Franklin  D. Roosevelt started the New Deal, which was a plan compiled of federal programs, including several focused on farming.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>The Federal Crop Insurance Corporation was a program created to carry out the government initiative to provide insurance for farmers' produce, which means that  farmers would receive compensation for crops, even if they were not sustained in that year.<br/><br/>On September 26, 1980, the program was expanded through Public Law 96-365.<br/><br/>Initially, participation in FCIC was voluntary. However, insurance premiums were subsidized by the U.S. government as a means of encouraging participation in the FCIC program.
